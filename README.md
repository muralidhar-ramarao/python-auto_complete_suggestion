# python-auto_complete_suggestion
AutoCompleteSuggestion python script.

Here is a small attempt to build a word auto complete suggestion in Python.

Use this script to get suggestions for completing the words you typed in. Please download the AutoCompleteSuggestion.py and words.txt for the program to work. You HAVE to place both these files in the same folder/directory for the script to work.

Check out the SampleOutput.png file for a sample usage.
